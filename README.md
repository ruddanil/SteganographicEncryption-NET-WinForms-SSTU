# SteganographicEncryption-NET-WinForms-SSTU

This is a C# WinForms program that showcases the capabilities of steganographic information hiding within an image.

In the left section, text is encrypted using the AES standard (Rijndael) and concealed within the least significant bits of the color component of each pixel in the image, employing a steganographic algorithm.
**_The resulting image visually has no differences from the original image without hidden text._**

On the right section, the concealed encrypted text within the image is extracted, and its decryption is performed. Additionally, there is a visual highlighting in red color on the original image to indicate the pixels that contained the hidden information.
